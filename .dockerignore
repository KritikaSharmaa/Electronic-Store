#.dockerignore only affects what gets sent to the Docker build context when you run:
.git        # Prevents your entire Git history from being sent to Docker
*.log       #Avoids shipping log files into the image
*.tmp       # Skips temp files
Dockerfile*     # Prevents the Dockerfile(s) from being copied into the image accidentally
README*     # Skips README docs (not needed in container)
*.class      # Excludes compiled Java class files (Spring Boot jar already contains them)
.DS_Store       # Mac OS finder metadata files â€” useless in container
node_modules    # Heavy node_modules folders (if you had frontend code here)
.idea           #.idea/ folder (IntelliJ configs) is in your project root
.mvn/
